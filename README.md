# RL-Tetris-Pro

This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve the 2D bin packing/space optimization problem, where the goal is to optimally arrange a set of irregular or rectangular shapes within a confined area to minimize wasted space. Leveraging Stable Baselines3 and custom OpenAI Gym environments, the agent learns to sequentially place objects while maximizing packing efficiency.

**🔍 Key Highlights:**

✅ Custom OpenAI Gym environment for 2D nesting/bin packing

🧠 Trained using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) from Stable Baselines3

📊 Metrics: Material utilization, packing density, placement time

🧩 Supports irregular and rectangular part configurations

📈 Visualizations of agent performance over episodes

🛠️ Libraries Used:
1. Python
2. Stable Baselines3
3. Gymnasium
4. NumPy
5. Matplotlib

**📦 Use Cases:**
1. Sheet metal nesting in manufacturing
2. Warehouse layout optimization
3. Logistics and container packing
